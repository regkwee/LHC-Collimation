\abstract{
  The study of machine induced background to the experiments is vital for several reasons. Too much background can be an issue for operation and the tricky part is to judge when it is ``too much''. It is a complex topic as -- besides the experiments -- many of the machine groups are involved (e.g.~collimation, vacuum, RF). A detailed study of background can also help understanding the machine better to identify potential issues and complemented by dedicated machine tests. Finally such a study is relevant for the experiments to analyse the characteristica of machine background to be sure not to count it as new physics signal.

  This report summarises simulation results of three background sources, local beam-gas, halo and for the first time off-momentum (IR3) leakage. The most dominant sources, halo and beam-gas, have been systematically studied for LHC Run~I and Run~II cases, and several HL--LHC scenarios. We analyse the evolution of background of these scenarios and discuss rates expected for HL. Leakages are analysed for both ATLAS and CMS while detailed shower simulations were performed for ATLAS only in all these scenarios.
