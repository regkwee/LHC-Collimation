\section{Simulation Techniques and Physics Scenarios\label{simSetup}}

The simulation of background in the LHC can be very demanding in terms of CPU as detailed shower simulations have to be performed along several hundred meters or many millions of primaries have to be tracked to get sufficient particles leaking to collimators in IR1 or IR5 which by definition is many orders of magnitudes lower than protons hitting the primary collimators. Two simulation codes were used as main tools: SixTrack for particle tracking around the ring and \fluka~for particle showering. 

The layout of nominal LHC is shown in Fig.~\ref{nominalLHC_layout} for intersertion region 1 (IR1) with the interaction point 1 (IP1) at s~=~0. By design, the left and the right side are symmetric for incoming and outgoing beams. For our purposes, shower evaluation from different background sources, it is sufficient to use only half of the layout for the incoming beam. 

%Note, that usually the distributions are indicated per interaction, for beam-halo (BH) simulations distributions are shown per hit in the tertiary collimators and for beam-gas (BG) it is given per proton-nitrogen interaction.

\subsection{Beam-Halo simulations}
The simulation is performed in two steps: First, we use SixTrack~\cite{SixTrackRef} for particle tracking in order to obtain the leakage onto the TCTs in the IRs. To be CPU efficient, only a halo proton distribution is tracked not the full beam with its core that is usually many orders of magnitude more dense. Tracking is performed through a magnetic field lattice, usually prepared using MadX, and the LHC collimatiors of which only the jaws are modeled. We also assume a perfect machine, neglecting any uneven jaw surfaces or edges\footnote{Previous studies REFERENCE have shown if one includes machine errors, the results differ by a factor of about 2.}.

The beam halo is usually simulated in horizontal (h) and vertical (v) distributions, these are flat in one plane and Gaussian in the other (for more information see also~\cite{chiarasThesis}). When a collimator is hit, a built-in, recently updated Monte-Carlo model~\cite{claudiasThesis} decides on the physics process. Protons continue in the lattice until they dissociate in an inelastic interaction with the collimator material or (in a post-processing step) are lost on the aperture. As a result, loss locations around the ring can be identified and protons absorbed by the TCTs serve in second step as seeds in \fluka~\cite{flukaRef1,flukaRef2}~to evaluate particle showers streaming towards the detector. Particle interaction and transport are calculated within matter for a user-defined geometry. It uses modern physics models and experimental data as available by the Particle Data Group~\cite{pdgRef}. The geometry was built up to 546~m of the right side of IR1 for the present LHC machine, for HL-LHC scenarios the geometry reaches up the tertiary collimators of around 215~m including the long straight section of IR1 (LSS1).

When halo protons interact with the jaw material of the TCTH or TCTV shower particles are created and stream towards the experiment. Every particle passing an imaginary (x,y)-plane at 22.6~m away from the IP, essentially between the triplet magnets and the TAS, is recorded and written out. The left plot of Fig.~\ref{tctHits} shows part of the \fluka~geometry and in green the hits in an horizontal collimator TCTH.4L1 with absorbed protons from an horizontal and vertical halo distribution. On the right of Fig.~\ref{tctHits} one can see how deep these positions are with respect to the jaw surface shown for the collimator pair of IR1. This depth distribution is shown here as an example and discussed in more detail together with the other simulation cases in Sec.~\ref{evolut}.

\subsection{Beam-Gas simulations}
Beam-gas interactions were simulated for Run I and Run II cases with \fluka~using a detailed geometry up to the arc until 546~m away from the IP. %, but with different magnetic fields for a 4 TeV and a 6.5 TeV proton beam and the respective optics.
The difference for the Run I and Run II geometry is merely in the generation of the magnetic fields for 4 TeV and 6.5 TeV respectively, the method of sampling beam-gas is the same. In \fluka, protons were forced to undergo an inelastic interaction with residual gas molecules on positions on the ideal orbit. A new technique used here includes the variation of the transverse beam size which in particular is large inside the triplet when the beam is squeezed final focussing. 
The sampling positions were read into \fluka~and like for the beam-halo simulations each shower particle reaching the interface plane at 22.6~m is used to dump information about fluxes towards the experiment. 

The normalisation to a real beam-gas rate can either be done at run-time or in a subsequent step if one keeps the information of the initial z-coordinate of the interacting proton per particle at the interface plane. The advantage of the second method is that distributions can be easily re-normalised to another pressure profile. More details are given directly per simulation case in Sect.\ref{run1run2}. For HL, the studies were already shown in Ref.~\cite{ipac2014_rkh} and they are still the most recent of this kind.% The normalisation with the intensity and pressure profile was done as follows: A representative fill of the run was selected and gauge data is used in the pressure simulation in order to interpolate in between the measurement points and also estimate the contribution per molecule type using the VAcuum Simulation COde, VASCO. The result file can then be re-weighted with the pressure in a subsequent step, thus the unweighted results correspond to a flat pressure. 

\subsection{New simulation techniques}
Previous studies as in Ref.~\cite{nimPaperRod} used methods relaying on approximations of either of the beam or on its trajectory. One approximation is that the transverse beam size was neglected. In particular, just before the triplet the beamsize is very large and addtional interactions in that location could contribute to shower particles at the interface plane. Another improvement in the simulations is the inclusion of the crossing-angle which was present right from start-up of the LHC.

\subsubsection{Setup to include the beam size}
To test the effect of the beam size, two cases were simulated in \fluka, with exactly the same setup for the 2012 Run I scenario, see Table~\ref{paramsRun12}, but using a different input file for positions at which beam-gas interactions are sampled.

The new input file was created by dumping positions of the trajectory with different starting positions. The ideal orbit goes through (0,0) in (x,y) at the IP. Assuming a gaussian distribution of the beam particles one can produce matched phase space coordinates in the transverse plane, as shown in Fig.~\ref{ip1_gauss}, at the IP where the optical functions are $\alpha = 0$, $\beta = \beta^* = 60$~cm. Using a normalised coordinate system, the phase space coordinates were calculated as in Eq.~\ref{eq1} and used as initial seeds in \fluka~to create the trajectory. 1000 trajectories were created and randomly 10 sampling positions per longitudinal coordinate were chosen. The final input file to \fluka~is visualised in Fig.~\ref{BGASflukaInp}. One would expect the beam size to be largest after the D1 at the entrance of the triplet in Fig.~\ref{ip1_gauss}~(a). Looking back to Fig.~\ref{nominalLHC_layout} we identify first a squeeze in x (red bottom box), then in y (purple top box) and then in x again and indeed this is also what we see if the beamsize is calculated theoretically using the MadX $\beta-$functions\footnote{given by $\sigma_{x,y} = \sqrt{\epsilon_{geo} \cdot \beta_{x,y}}$ with $\epsilon_{\textrm{geo}} = \frac{ \epsilon_{\textrm{n}}}{\gamma_{\textrm{rel}}}$} as shown in Fig.~\ref{twissfileBS}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq1}
  \begin{split}
x = & \, \sqrt{\beta \epsilon} \cdot X \\
x' = & \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_{geo}}{\beta}} \, \big( X' - \alpha X \big)
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

with $\epsilon$ being the geometric emittance, $\alpha, \beta$ and $\gamma$ the usual twiss parameters from the definition of the emittance as conservative in $\epsilon = \gamma x^2 + \beta x'^2 + 2 \alpha x x'$, and $X$ and $X'$ satisfying the circle equation, $X^2 + X'^2 = 1$.

%% %Muons, Protons
A global view on particle distributions in $\phi$ shows that the former peaks, in particular when looking at Fig.~\ref{bsRatioPhiAll} in the vertical plane at $\pm\frac{\pi}{2}$ is ``washed out'' but else no major differences can be observed. 

The distributions per species, muons and protons, are shown in Fig.~\ref{bsRatioPhiMP} and one can observe clearly in the proton distributions that the shoulders are a little wider and instead the peak is not as high as when no beam size was taken into account. For muons one can conclude it does not change anything significantly.

Having a closer look to proton distributions we investigate if an increase is visible where the beam size is indeed large just downstram the interface plane, from 22.6 to 59~m. Comparing the shapes per z-region of all particles and protons only one can see most of the energy comes from protons as visible from Fig.~\ref{bsZ2}. A direct comparison of the shapes in Fig.~\ref{bsZ} reveals all differences are almost entirely due to protons.

\subsubsection{Simulations with crossing angle}
The motivation to introduce a crossing angle in the machine is to avoid parasitic interactions of the beam while they travel in the same beam pipe in the interaction region. A small crossing angle allows for a quasi head-on collision of two bunches while other bunches are kept separated. The amount of the crossing angle is given by beam-beam effects which one wants to suppress and is trade-off between maximising luminosity and keeping the beam stable. The plane in which the angle is introduced is chosen such that one can compensate partially another long-range beam-beam effect resulting in either a positive or negative tune shift. While in IR1 the crossing angle is in the vertical plane, it is in the horizontal plane in IR5.

In all simulations from 4~TeV onwards, it was possible in \fluka~to consider such a crossing angle.

\subsection{Run I and Run II simulation cases}
For Run I and II, real physics configurations of the LHC were used for most of the $pp$ physics runs in 2012 and 2015. At 4~TeV in 2012, the optics were for a $\beta^* = 60$ cm and TCT collimator settings in IR1/IR5 TCTs were set to 9~$\sigma$~\cite{parametersRun1}. For Run II, the optics changed to $\beta^* = 80$~cm which was used in the machine throughout 2015 for proton-proton collisions and IR1/IR5 collimators were set to 13.7~$\sigma$. For both runs, a vertical crossing angle of $290~\mu$m was taken into account in the simulations. More simulation and run parameters can be found in Tab.~\ref{paramsRun12}.

\subsection{HL-LHC simulation cases}

Several cases were simulated in order to characterise the cleaning efficiency for baseline settings of HL-LHC and variants and to estimate quantitatively any advantages in terms of background with different collimator layouts. An alternative set of collimator openings, so called \twosigmaret~settings, was prepared based on experience with the machine and is listed in Tab.~\ref{HLcollSettings}. In particular, the aim was to quantify the effect of additional tertiary collimators, TCT5s, for incoming beams (B1 and B2). Inelastic interactions with beam protons are forced in \fluka~at initial conditions given by SixTrack on the TCT4s and (when included) TCT5s. These interactions generate a particle flux towards the experiment. All shower particles are recorded at the machine-detector interface plane at 22.6~m from the IP using in \fluka~a production and transportation cut-off at 20 MeV. Section~\ref{hllhcResults} is dedicated to all the HL simulation details.
