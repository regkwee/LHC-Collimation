\section{Background sources}
Several sources in the machine contribute to background signals in the experiments (often also refered to as \textit{MIB} - machine induced background). Two of these sources are most relevant for the experiments: One are induced by beam protons interacting with residual gas molecules, refered to as \textit{beam-gas}, while for the other one beam halo protons interact with the tertiary collimators around $\pm$150~m away from the IP on each side of the incoming beam. Both sources are considered here and described in the following. Other sources are e.g.~cross-talk where scattered protons in an elastic or inelastic interaction process at an IP is intercepted in another TCT where it creates a shower towards the respective experiment. 

\subsection{Beam-Gas}

Beam-gas interactions can be divided into different classes depending on whether they collisions are close to the experiment (\textit{local beam-gas}) or far out (\textit{global beam-gas}) and whether it was an inelastic or elastic interaction. Here, the focus is on local beam-gas simulations as local pressure peaks are found to correlate well with observed background in the experiment~\cite{nimPaperRod}.

\subsection{Beam-Halo}
Beam particles in the accelerator oscillate around an ideal orbit but diffuse out the beam core due to various beam dynamics effects (e.g.~particle-particle scattering within a bunch, interactions between colliding bunches, scattering with residual gas-molecules) forming the \textit{beam halo} and unavoidable losses. The task of the collimation system is to safely remove these halo particles in two dedicated insertion regions, IR7 for betatron and IR3 for momentum cleaning~\cite{LHCDesignRep,collRef}. Tertiary collimators (TCTs) in the experimental IR's complement the IR7/3 collimators and are installed to provide local protection of the inner triplet magnets. Halo protons leaking from IR7/3, should mostly be stopped by the TCTs. While interacting with the collimator material, they produce particle showers that contribute to the machine-induced halo background. 

Note, in the experiments the term halo is often used as muon-halo since these particles will not be stopped but rather pass the detector even at very large (transverse) radii. The high energetic halo induced muons at large radii are of particular interest to the experiments as they will produce fake jet signals in the calorimeter and must be indentified in order to substract them from any jet-based physics analysis. 

The topology of this background source and their frequencey is therefore extensively studied in the following chapters.
