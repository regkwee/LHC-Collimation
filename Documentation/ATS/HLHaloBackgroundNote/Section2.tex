\section{Conclusion and outlook}

We investigated in detail and systematically two sources of background, beam-gas and beam-halo, the most relevant sources for the experiments. The study was carried out for IR1 and both beams in general. Although there is a layout symmetry for incoming beams in one IR, both beams have a different ``history'' which will result in different backround patterns.
